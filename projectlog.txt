Questions for project, is there a way to split army selection between AoS and 40k?yes with database
Need to add Login/Register page
How many tables will I need for DB? 5-6
How exactly to I put the game information on the page so someone can select it, and how do I do the notifications?
	Make it a link, but see if you can use CSS to make it look like something other than just a hyperlink.
	
Buying a domain name?  Recommendations? - Yes, free one available as part of student package.

Future addition to Beacon, chat feature???

Databases needed:,
Users, need to add authentication
Games
Army options (unless I go with just 40k on deployment)

How to notify someone? Leave opening in 'Games' database? When a user clicks on 'I'm your huckleberry' it should
fill that open column and send notification?

Classes needed:
jsps for the four pages (created, roughed in)
servlets, for all four?
bean for user info (created, roughed in)
bean for game info??
bean for army info, or since that would just go to jsp, not needed?
